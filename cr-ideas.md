# Corbin's Random Idea's

* Budget Web App using Plaid's API
* Personal Asset Management System (copyright, Corbin Roth 2022)
 * Think of a personal form builder centered around the things you own (assets). For example, what year is your vehicle? VIN#? Wheel Size? These are all pieces of info we need...but don't need all the time. I need my cars wheel size when replacing a tire.
* Specific Nashville Traffic Map / makes better routing decisions based on Nashville norms.
 * IDK How we would do this...there is an awesome API/SDK out there but I am pretty sure it costs $$$.
